# Contextual-Bandits

This repo contains a notebook `algorithms.ipynb` which implements the following bandit algorithms:
1. Thompson Sampling with a well-specified prior
2. Thompson Sampling with a mis-specified prior
3. Thompson Sampling for Gaussian Bandits with different suboptimality gap parameters
4. UCB for Gaussian Bandits with different suboptimality gap parameters

There are some basic imports in the first cell of `algorithms.ipynb`. After installing these libraries, you should be able to run each cell in the notebook sequentially without issues to run the simulations and reproduce the plots.
